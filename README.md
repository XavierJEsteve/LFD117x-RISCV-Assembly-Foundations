# LFD117x-RISCV-Assembly-Foundations
Code I've written based on instruction from LFC117x "Foundations of RISC-V Assembly Programming" on edX

The content of the course covers the RISC-V instruction set architecture (RV32I, RV64I), pseudo instructions and assembly directives, application programming interface, interfacing with C-libraries, and understanding disassemblies.

Expected Demonstratable Skills upon completion of this project:
-Discuss the RISC-V GNU toolchain.
-Gain an understanding of the RISC-V ISA.
-Program RISC-V assembly on the user level.
-Implement your own programs runnable with RISC-V Linux.
-Understand disassembly and debugging output.
